Instructions:

Objective:
The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs of cards.
Setup:
1. The game board should consist of 16 cards arranged in a 4x4 grid. 2. Each
card has a front side and a back side. The back side displays a unique letter
(A-H) that forms a pair with one other card.
3. At the start of the game, all cards are placed face down.
How to Play:
1. Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal the letters on their back
sides.
2. If the letters on the two flipped cards match, those cards will remain face up,
indicating they have been successfully matched.
3. If the letters do not match, the cards will flip back over to their face-down
position after a short delay.
4. Continue flipping pairs of cards until all matching pairs have been found.

Rules:
1. Only two cards can be flipped at a time.
2. If two flipped cards do not match, they will be flipped back over after 1
second.
3. The game ends when all pairs have been successfully matched.

Tips:
● Try to remember the positions and letters of previously flipped cards to find
matches more efficiently.
● Start by flipping over different pairs each time to gain more information about
the card positions.

Winning the Game:
You win the game when you have successfully matched all 8 pairs of cards, and all
cards are face up.
Enjoy playing the memory game and challenge yourself to complete it as
